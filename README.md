    npm install gulp-cli -g if not yet installed

2.  **Start developing.**

    Run the `watch.sh` file

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

## 🔥 Build

1.  **Build File**

    Run the `build.sh` file

2.  **Check it out.**

    By default the exported `index.html` file is located in `test/index.html`

    You can adjust this in the `gulpfile.js`

    You currently need to manually delete the excess `<head></head>` content and `scripts`
<!-- ## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    ├── README.md
    └── yarn.lock

  1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.  
  
  2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.
  
  3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.
  
  4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.
  
  5.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.
  
  6.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).
  
  7.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.
  
  8.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.
  
  9.  **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.
  
  10.  **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**
  
  11.  **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.
  
  12.  **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
  
  13.  **`yarn.lock`**: [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is a package manager alternative to npm. You can use either yarn or npm, though all of the Gatsby docs reference npm.  This file serves essentially the same purpose as `package-lock.json`, just for a different package management system.
